# Talabia Chess
Talabia Chess is a variant of chess played on a 7x6 board.

## Pieces
**Point** ⬆️

The Point piece can only move forward, 1 or 2 steps. If it reaches the end of the board, it turns around and starts heading back the other way. It cannot skip over other pieces.

**Hourglass** ⏳

The Hourglass piece moves in a 3x2 L shape in any orientation (kind of like the knight in standard chess.) This is the only piece that can skip over other pieces.

**Time** ✖️

The Time piece can only move diagonally but can go any distance. It cannot skip over other pieces.

**Plus** ➕

The Plus piece can move horizontally and vertically only but can go any distance. It cannot skip over other pieces.

**Sun** ☀️

The Sun piece can move only one step in any direction. The game ends when the Sun is captured by the other side.

## Other rules
After 2 turns (counting one yellow move and one blue move as one turn), all Time pieces will turn into Plus pieces, and all Plus pieces will turn into Time pieces.
